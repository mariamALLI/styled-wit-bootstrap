- Secondly within the inner divs created in the container included the image src, followed by the hearder-text.class for h1, sub-text.class for p and the button which had an attribute of class btn btn1 2 3 value respectively.
- Thirdly the layout was desinged and styled using Bootstrap and personal external file CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- CSS Grid
- Positioning
- media queries

### What I learned

Some of my major learnings while working through this project included how to use bootstrap. 

```css
In the media query section 
.proud-of-this-css {
  border-bottom-left-radius: 15px;
  border-top-right-radius: 0px;
}
```

### Continued development
Will continue my development and perfect my skill on CSS GRID
and bootstrap
